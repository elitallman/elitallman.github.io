## School Projects ##

These are a few noteworthy or interesting school projects that I had an important role in developing or created on my own.

 - MedSim
     - This was a final project in my software engineering class. We used best practices in software engineering and a waterfall development model. The program allows a medical student to simulate scanning a patient's wristband and administering medication, with sound and popup prompts that inform them if they made a mistake. The program is deployed on a tablet or large phone, and uses the built-in rear camera to scan QR codes.
         - Implemented the QR code reading, employing several 3rd libraries and open source projects, found workarounds for threading issues related to using the tablet webcam.
         - Responsible for much of the interface design, backend, and modeling implementation
         - Functioned as implementation leader and project manager

 - Top Gun
     - This was a project in a Java class. I used UML and graphs to implement a fully functioning sidescrolling 2D video game with scoring, lives, and dynamically generated scenery.
