These are projects that aren't on GitHub or  on which I wanted to give more detailed information

## School Projects ##

These are a few noteworthy or interesting school projects that I had an important role in developing or created on my own.

 - MedSim
     - This was a final project in my software engineering class. We used best practices in software engineering and a waterfall development model. The program allows a medical student to simulate scanning a patient's wristband and administering medication, with sound and popup prompts that inform them if they made a mistake. The program is deployed on a tablet or large phone, and uses the built-in rear camera to scan QR codes. All the purpleness came from my university's color theme. We might have made the shade just a little too bright haha.
         - Implemented the QR code reading, employing several 3rd libraries and open source projects, found workarounds for threading issues related to using the tablet webcam.
         - Responsible for much of the interface design, backend, and modeling implementation
         - Functioned as implementation leader and project manager

 - Top Gun
     - A project in a Java class. I used UML and graphs to implement a fully functioning sidescrolling 2D video game with scoring, lives, and dynamically generated scenery.

  - Toptravel
     - One of the projects in an algorithms class involved using an 'abstract data type' adjacency list and topological depth first search to figure out the best way to take a series of classes with prerequisites. In addition to completing the project, I made a program that visually demonstrated the traversal of the graph

   - Duke vs Tux Tic Tac Toe
    - Made a networked Tic Tac Toe game in VB.NET that used TCP/IP and socket programming

   - Auto Loan Calculator
     - Java application and web applet for calculating a long list of fees and balances when purchasing a car. The interface was not complex but the underlying calculations and dynamic updating was tricky.

## Research Projects ##

 - FastTrack hand tracking system
    - This project was for the physical therapy department at my university. I transformed raw directional cosine matrix data into averages of hand movement in order for researchers to determine the optimal angle to fuse
    a wrist (in patients that, for whatever reason, lost proper use of it). The program was written in Python and coordinated the workflow of collecting the data by the operator of the system.

 - BearClaw glove-game augmented physical therapy system
     - I was fortunate enough to be able to participate in a summer-long REU (Research Experience for Undergraduates) program at my unversity and work on this system. I contributed to the game development (scripting,
     game logic, and some graphical modeling) and interoperability between the glove and the phone that was communicating with it. This project was initially conceived and implemented by other researchers, but during 
     this time the game was rewritten and the glove improved.
