Hi, I'm Eli.

I am a software developer with experience in a wildly diverse array of languages, technologies, and platforms. My focus is currently on the Python web development stack (Flask, Django, Pyramid), future-proof dependency management and versioning (the current state of dependency management is an absolute mess), and simplified load-balancing and concurrency platforms for web and application development.

Some of my favorite technologies/projects/ideas:
* Flask
* Ansible
* Postgrest
* Python
* Developer ecosystem and lifestyle
