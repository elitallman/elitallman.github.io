Hi, I'm Eli.

I am a software developer with experience in a wildly diverse array of languages, technologies, and platforms. My focus is currently on the Python web development stack (Flask, Django, Pyramid), future-proof dependency management and versioning, and simplified load-balancing and concurrency platforms for web and application development. I also have an interest in improving public awareness of computing and its contributors and the developer ecosystem and lifestyle.

Some of my current favorite technologies/projects:<br />
* Flask<br />
* Ansible<br />
* Postgrest<br />
* Python<br />
